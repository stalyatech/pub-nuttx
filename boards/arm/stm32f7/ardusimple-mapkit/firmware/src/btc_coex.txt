btc_mode=1
==========
Full TDM mode, When one side has priority, it has full control of the shared resource.

btc_mode=4
==========
BT is always allowed to use the medium. WLAN keeps the normal activity.

btc_mode=5
==========
Some simultaneous activities are allowed.

btc_params1:
============
WLAN PS mode duration in coex mode in us.
Specifies WLAN PS mode duration when yielding to BT.
Larger value will keep WLAN in PS mode longer increasing BT throughput while decreasing WLAN throughput.
This parameter does not affect regular WLAN PS mode. Default is 7500 us.

btc_params8:
============
BT deferral limit.
This parameter allows setting a limit on how long BT can be denied air-time.
If this parameter is set BT will be guaranteed access within a certain time specified as parameter 10. Default is 25000.

btc_params9:
============
WLAN PS mode duration in coex mode in us as BT slave device.
Similar to parameter 1 except this parameter is applied when COEX device is served as BT slave device.  Default is 15000 us.

btc_params50:
=============
It will improve the priority of the BT side. Default is 0x17ec.

Increase the "params 9" since you are using BT as sink mode, "params 1" is used on BT master mode.
